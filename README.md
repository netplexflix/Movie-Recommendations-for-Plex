## üçø Plex collection
Adding labels instead of directly creating a collection gives you more freedom to create a smart collection in Plex.
- Go to your movie library
- Click on All => Advanced filters
- Filter on your chosen 'label' and set any other criteria
- For example; you could append the recommendations to a longer list, then 'limit to' 5 for example, and 'sort by' randomly.
- Click on the arrow next to 'Save as' and click on 'Save as Smart Collection'
- Give the collection a name like 'Recommended Movies' and pin it to your home to get 5 random recommendations every time you refresh your home
